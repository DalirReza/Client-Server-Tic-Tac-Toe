# Tic_Tac_Toe
In this project I have implemented a multi-threaded server-client architecture for a scalable Tic-tac-toe game, supporting 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 boards. The server handles game logic and player coordination, while the client ensures smooth user interaction and game state updates. it uses a good GUI suitable for this game.
